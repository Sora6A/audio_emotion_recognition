This is a MATLAB project that uses a neural network with one hidden layer for speech emotion recognition. Running batch_audio_converter.m will segment the speech files into single-channel audio files with a 2-second duration and a sampling rate of 16000. The positive examples should be placed in the /audiofile/positive folder, and the negative examples should be placed in the /audiofile/negative folder. Open test_NN_audio_recognition.m, set the hyperparameters, and start training.
